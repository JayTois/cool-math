Main Features
    - Changed my game.tile.component to be object-oriented, and use loops
    - so now all i have to do is add an image, title, and description and its golden
    - This was done by adding two new TS files. One including a list of objects, and another with a constructor for it.

Bonus
    - I did the exact same thing for my game.genre.component. no more copying and pasting html stuff!
